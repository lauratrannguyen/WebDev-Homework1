5. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
I had A LOT of trouble with this assignment:
- I couldn't view my sshd_config file properly at first, as it was a black and white screen. However, I just reconnected the vps with my username and I managed to get the sshd
- I had difficulty logging into the ssh, as I kept getting permission denied. I found that starting off with a completely new user helped me go part the permission denied stage
- I also had difficulty getting my hw01 to show on the browser, so after 2 hours of debugging, I cleared my cache, and that solved all my problems
- The scp was difficult to follow at first, but then I just reread the documentation 100 times and managed successfully upload my image
